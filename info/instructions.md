# Ways to use CSS in your HTML.

## Linking your CSS file

<p>This is a small little instruction document on how to connect your CSS file to your HTML file.</p>

<p>In your HTML file, you want to nest this link tag within the head tag of your HTML file. For example:</p>

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" types="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  <title>...</title>
</head>
```

<p>In the link tag, you have an href attribute. You will link your external CSS file within this property.</p>

<p>You can name your css file index.css or styles.css (there' multiple conventions when naming your CSS files but when putting your styles in one style sheet, you'll either name them index.css or styles.css)</p>

<p>Next we'll talk about using CSS.</p>
